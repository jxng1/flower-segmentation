Segmentation models trained using Oxford flower category dataset

The code in this repository provides functionality for training and evaluating segmentation models on the Oxford flower category dataset. It includes usage of various state-of-the-art segmentation architectures, such as U-Net, DeepLabv3, and Mask R-CNN. These models can be used to accurately segment flower images into different categories.

<b>Requisites</b>:
- MATLAB <i>(>=R2024a)</i>

To get started, make sure:
- Dataset is downloaded and properly organized in the expected directory structure(ensure image dimensions are 256x256)
- In the MATLAB code files, you can easily configure parameters, and dictate training/segmentation options through the use.

Future plans include expanding self-defined architecture, and improving accuracy with different methods.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different architectures and hyper-parameters. Happy flower segmentation!
