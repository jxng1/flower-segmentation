Segmentation models trained using Oxford flower category dataset

The code in this repository provides functionality for training and evaluating segmentation models on the Oxford flower category dataset. It includes usage of various state-of-the-art segmentation architectures, such as U-Net, DeepLabv3, and Mask R-CNN. These models can be used to accurately segment flower images into different categories.

To get started, make sure you have the dataset downloaded and properly organized in the expected directory structure. Then, you can run the training script to train the segmentation models on the dataset. After training, you can use the evaluation script to assess the performance of the trained models on the test set.

Future plans include expanding self-defined architecture, and improving accuracy with different methods.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different architectures and hyper-parameters. Happy flower segmentation!
